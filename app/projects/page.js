              A comprehensive web application for managing Transylvanian student
              conferences. Features include student registration, essay
              submissions, teacher approvals, and conference management. Built
              with a three-tier architecture: central server, web application,
              and database. The backend was developed using Spring Boot, and the
              frontend was built with React. The design was created in Figma,
              and the database used was MySQL, with MinIO for document storage.
